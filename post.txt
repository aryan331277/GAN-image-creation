🚀 AI that paints landscapes? 🎨🌄
I built and trained a GAN to generate realistic landscapes in just one week! 🌍✨ The journey was intense, full of rapid learning, and challenging, but the results were worth it!

🛠 Steps I Followed:
🔹 Data Preparation – Curated and preprocessed a dataset of landscapes.
🔹 Model Architecture:
Generator: Used Conv2DTranspose layers with ReLU activations to upsample images progressively.
Discriminator: Built with Conv2D layers and LeakyReLU activations to classify real vs. generated images.
🔹 Training & Optimization – Experimented with hyperparameters for stable learning.
🔹 Fine-Tuning – Adjusted learning rates, loss functions, and optimizers (Adam with β=0.5).
🔹 Evaluation – Monitored d_loss (~0.46) and g_loss (~1.89) to ensure stability.

🚧 Challenges Faced:
🔸 Mode collapse – Initially, the generator produced repetitive outputs.
🔸 Discriminator overpowering – Had to balance training to avoid an overfitted discriminator.

🌟 Future Plans:
✅ Further improving image quality using Progressive Growing GANs.
✅ Exploring StyleGAN for more artistic control.
 
GANs continue to amaze me with their potential in art, design, and AI creativity! Would love to hear feedback and ideas from the community! 💡🚀
